# Image Collection Captioning

This is the dataset for image collection caption which is extent from <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home" target="_blank">MS-COCO</a> dataset. This dataset is part of the paper [1].

## Dataset

The dataset is built upon the MS-COCO dataset by estimating the semantic contents of images and captions and using this to augment the dataset toward image collection captioning. To construct a dataset for the proposed task, we implement and compare two approaches based on image classification and image-caption retrieval.

`coco_resnet101_splited.json` : is a dataset that is split by classifying the semantic contents of each image.

`coco_vsepp_splited.json`: is a dataset that is split by estimating the semantic contents and captions with VSE++
